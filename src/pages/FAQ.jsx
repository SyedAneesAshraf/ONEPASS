      question: "When will ONEPASS AI launch?",
      answer: "We're aiming for early 2025. Join the waitlist and you'll be first to know when we go live, plus you'll get exclusive founding-member pricing."
    },
    {
      question: "How much will it cost?",
      answer: "Simple, transparent pricing. One plan, all tools. We'll share exclusive founding-member pricing with waitlist members that's significantly lower than what you'd pay for individual subscriptions."
    },
    {
      question: "What kinds of tools are included?",
      answer: "Everything from design and creativity tools to copywriting, video editing, research, coding, and automation tools. We're adding more premium AI tools every month based on user feedback and emerging technologies."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to install anything?",
      answer: "Nope! Everything runs in your browser. Just log in to your ONEPASS AI dashboard and start creating. No downloads, no installations, no technical setup required."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We believe in flexibility. You can cancel your subscription at any time with no penalties or hidden fees."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you choose which tools to include?",
      answer: "We hand-pick tools based on quality, user value, and feedback from our community. No bloat, no filler â€“ only tools that creators, founders, and solopreneurs actually use and love."
    },
    {
      question: "Will there be usage limits?",
      answer: "Our goal is to provide unlimited access to all included tools. Some premium features might have fair-use policies, but we're designed for heavy creators and power users."
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from buying tools individually?",
      answer: "Instead of juggling multiple subscriptions, logins, and billing cycles, you get everything in one place. Plus, you'll likely save hundreds of dollars per month compared to individual subscriptions."
